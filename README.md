# HelloCMake

## Overview

This is a simple C++ project that demonstrates how to set up and build a project using **CMake**. The project includes a single C++ file (`main.cpp`) that prints "Hello, CMake!" to the console.

## Project Structure

```
HelloCMake/
│
├── build/           # Directory for build files generated by CMake
├── CMakeLists.txt   # CMake configuration file
└── main.cpp         # C++ source file
```

## Requirements

- **CMake** (Version 3.10 or higher)
- **C++ Compiler** (e.g., GCC or Clang)

## Build Instructions

1. Clone or download this project into a directory.

2. Open a terminal and navigate to the `HelloCMake` directory.

3. Create a `build` directory inside the project folder:

    ```bash
    mkdir build
    cd build
    ```

4. Run CMake to generate the build files:

    ```bash
    cmake ..
    ```

5. Use `make` to build the project:

    ```bash
    make
    ```

6. After the project is built, you can run the executable:

    ```bash
    ./HelloCMake
    ```

    The output should be:

    ```
    Hello, CMake!
    ```

## Explanation of Files

- **main.cpp**: Contains the source code for a simple C++ program that outputs "Hello, CMake!".
- **CMakeLists.txt**: Defines how the project is built using CMake. It specifies the minimum CMake version, the project name, and the source files to compile.
